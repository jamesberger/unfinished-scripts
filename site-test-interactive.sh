# Description:
# ------------
# This runs a quick check to see if our user can log into a website
# Curl logs into the site and places the resulting logged in page 
# into a file. Then we grep the file and see if a string that shows 
# up when you're logged in is present. If so, it does nothing.
# If not, it alerts you.



#Setting our variables
results_file=/tmp/simple-page-check_server-page.html
target_url=https://www.your-site-goes-here.com/login.html
phrase_to_check_for=PutYourPhraseThatShowsUpOnTheLoggedInPageHere #note - need to fix this so you can set it to something with spaces in it instead of a single word
log_file=/tmp/simple-page-check_server-status-log.txt

# Note: You may have to update these fields depending on how the form on the target page is requesting the data.
# If the form asks for a variable "userName", you're good. If it's called something different, then change
# "userName" to whatever it's looking for.
# So --data "userName=YourUserNameGoesHere" \ could become --data "User=YourUserNameGoesHere" \ for example.
